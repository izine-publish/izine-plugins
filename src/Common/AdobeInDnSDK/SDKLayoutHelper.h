/** Helper methods to perform basics of manipulating the layout
	content in a document.

	All frame creation methods expect the bounds of the object to be
	created to be given in the bounds of the parent. Normally the parent
	will be a spread layer (ISpreadLayer), which implies the bounds are given
	in spread co-ordinates.

	To assist in laying out content relative to the page origin (which is the
	top left corner of the page) a helper method SDKLayoutHelper::PageToSpread
	is provided. This will transform the bounds of a frame from page co-ordinates
	to spread co-ordinates ready to be passed to one of the frame creation methods
	like SDKLayoutHelper::CreateRectangleFrame.
