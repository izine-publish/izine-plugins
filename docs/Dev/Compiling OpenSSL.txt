Open a Visual Studio 2005 Command prompt and add references to the Microsoft SDK as following:

SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\bin
SET LIB=%LIB%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Lib
SET INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Include

cd to your openssl uncompressed folder

Now we simply have to follow the tasks listed in INSTALL.W32:

perl Configure VC-WIN32 –prefix=c:/openssl
ms\do_masm
nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
