Guidelines for modifying the iZinePublish plugins on Mac.

1. Don't modify the following files manually, these can be modified only on windows:-
	"IZP ClassDefinitions_Auto.fri" & "IZP ClassDefinitions_Auto.fri", use the "Design Details.xlsm" to update this.
	"IZPFactoryList_Auto.h" & "IZPUIFactoryList_Auto.h", use the visual studio macro "UpdateIntefaceFactories" defined in  svn at "iZinePlns\Docs\Dev\VSMacros\RJK_InDn\RJK_InDn.vsmproj".

2. Following files are shown as red(missing) by XCode, don't modify these, as this setting is done intentionally:-
	InDesignModel.framework
	IZP.fr.rsrc
	InDesignModelAndUI.framework
	IZPUI.fr.rsrc

3. The target names can be set to anything

4. To create a new target
	Create a new xcconfig file by copying the similar one.
	Modify the new xcconfig file.
	Duplicate any existing target, and set the dependent on xcconfig.
	No other change is required.

5. To modify any setting, make chagnes in the xcconfig file only. Project file contains only the file list and build rules. When "Get info" is viewed on Project/Target, then "defined at this level" list must be empty.

6. To compile on a new machine, specify the local paths in "InDnLocalPaths.xcconfig" present at svn/iZinePlns/Codebase/trunk

7. "svn/iZinePlns/Codebase/trunk/iZinePublishPlns.xcodeproj" can be used to compile both the plugins in one click.

Note: As the UI plugin uses some global variables from model pln, so to link the UI plugin, output of both the plugins must be in same directory.
